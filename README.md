# Employee Data Analysis

# Objective

Objective of this study is to design a data engineering model from scratch using employees HR details data from the 1980s and 1995s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are clustered into six CSV files. In this project, I am  designing the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs 
into a SQL database, import to HDFS/Hive using Sqoop, and perform analysis using Hive/Impala/Spark/SparkML using the data and create piplines.


## Steps
1. Database Creation using SQL
2. Transfer data to HDFS using Sqoop
3. Creating Tables in hive
4. Analysis using Hive and Impala
5. Loading Data in Spark
6. Analysis using SparkSQL and Pandas
7. Modeling using SparkML
8. Design Pipelines
